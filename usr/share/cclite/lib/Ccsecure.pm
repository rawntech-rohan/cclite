=head1 SYNOPSIS

Security routines for Cclite

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This package deals with session and security management. Currently sessions
are via tokens. Tokens are hashes of IP address and validated password.
They shouldn't work from a new address by being transported.

Action completes OK or it's a violation. If it's a violation, it's logged.

Note that nearly every other routine within Cclite can consume a token.
This is usually the last input paramter for any given subroutine.

This isn't used at present but the idea is many watertight doors rather
than a perimeter and a leaky interior.

I expect to put public key processing for GPG email
and similar here too.

This can now use the pure Perl SHA package.
The idea is to enable a full installation where a user may not be able
to use CPAN. However Digest::SHA2 will be much faster.

=head3  _get_digest

Returns a SHA digest. Digest SHA1
is potentially collision prone but available on
many commodity hosting platforms, so it's default
if cclite can't find SHA2

=cut

    my ( $url_type, @hash_items ) = @_;

=head3 text_to_hash

This is a tramp function that exposes _get_digest

=cut

sub text_to_hash {

    my ($text) = @_;
    my $url_type = 0;
    my $hash = _get_digest( $url_type, ($text) );
    return $hash;

}

=head3 compare_password

Compares the input hashed password with the stored one.
Normally this would take place over an https connection too.

=cut

sub compare_password {
    my ( $password_in, $cleartext, $password_stored ) = @_;
    $log->debug("compare password $password_in, $cleartext, $password_stored") ;
    if ( $password_in ne $password_stored ) {    # already hashed
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}

=head3 calculate_token

The token is a hash of the user, their current address (avoids some man
in the middle and some replay and the private value which is never exposed
to the network and changed frequently (we hope).

As of 2008, there's 

The hashref is either the fields reference or the cookie reference

=cut

sub calculate_token {
    my ( $registry_private_value, $fieldsref, $cookieref, $remote_address ) =
      @_;
    my $token;
    my $url_type = 1;    # these are url type hashes
    if ( !length($cookieref) ) {
        my ( $sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday, $isdst ) =
          localtime(time);

        #FIXME: time gives a little volatility but improve EGD perhaps?

    }
    $log->error(
"in token calc, fatal problem: $registry_private_value, u:$$fieldsref{'userLogin'}, ip:$remote_address"
    );
}

=head3 valid_token

recalculate the token for existing input, return true, if it still works
and compare it. Return 1 if the recalculated token is valid.

This is switched off at present and maybe should become dead code...

=cut

sub valid_token {

    my ( $registry_private_value, $user, $remote_address, $token ) = @_;
    my $url_type = 0;
    my $compare =

        return 1;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}

=head3 calculate_api_key

The hashed api key is the api key + the remote address

FIXME:This version loops through a list of comma separated allowed ip addresses. This is not very scalable and possibly error-prone
however, it does permit one cclite installation to serve several passthroughs

=cut

sub calculate_api_hash {

    my ( $db, $token ) = @_;
    my @calculated_hashes;
    my ( $registry_error, $hash_ref ) =

        push @calculated_hashes, $merchant_key_hash;
    }

    return \@calculated_hashes;
}

=head3 compare_api_key

FIXME: This is not in its final form, which should be OAuth based, this is proof of concept
If this fails, some logging should be included, possible break-in
The hashed api key is the api key (which should be a gpg key after a while) for the registry, the remote address

FIXME:This version loops through a list of comma separated addresses. This is not very scalable and possibly error-prone
however, it does permit a single cclite installation to serve several passthroughs

=cut

=head3 hash_password

put the password into a hash
changed this to change the hashing method, currently sha2

url_type is 0 
=cut

=head3 get_server_details

find out where served using environment variables
 ---- check for phishing here?

Domain is now deduced as first bit of path, not server correctly
on desktop debian for example 11/2009, this affects cookie release
as Laura's note...

FIXME: Not rigorous since https and 443 aren't 'married'

=cut

    my $portstring = ":$ENV{SERVER_PORT}"
      if ( $ENV{SERVER_PORT} != 80 && $ENV{SERVER_PORT} != 443 );

    my $home = "$httpstring$domain$portstring$ENV{SCRIPT_NAME}";

    return ( $home, $domain );

}

=head3 log_violation

Log token failures etc. here..needs a new db table
creates a record in om_log, type, user, ipaddress

There also needs to be a fingerprint log for transactions too

This is probably taken care of using log4perl right now

=cut

sub log_violation {

    return 1;
}

=head3 random_password

Generate a fairly random password for one that's
been forgotten

=cut

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"
    );

grumble about installer present and writable files etc.
mainly installer for the present

    # and hard to fix...

=head3 is_admin

Very crude method of determining whether the administration script is being run.
Should be replaced by something more secure and subtle.

Should also check token to provide some assurance that session is not hijacked

=cut
