FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS... 

 data.handle config
 automagic proxy offsets
 document::mouseleave?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.5, Released 2009-03-24

- Added "dragstart" and "dragend" special event configurations which prevents 
default event bindings in Internet Explorer (some events were firing twice).

- Added a custom "ondragstart" handler for IE only to suppress image/text drags

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.4, Released 2009-01-26

- Fixed a mistake where the "which" property was not correctly checked.

- Changed the initial test for checking if a drag is already underway (within 
the shared handler) to an internal property instead of checking for the document

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.3, Released 2009-01-26

- Now Compatable with jQuery 1.3.x and jQuery 1.2.x

- Fixed a problem with the return value of event handlers. Now use the property
"event.result" instead of the (obsolete) return value of "jQuery.event.handle"

- Fixed the logic for determining the proxy element returned from "dragstart", 
The document was being set as the proxy when dragstart returned undefined, and
this caused an error in the offset method in jQuery 1.3

- Added "document.selection.empty()" to the private static "selectable" function
Thanks José Mata.

- Added a "which" property to the "jQuery.event.special.drag" object, which 
defines the mouse button to "accept" on mousedown to initialize draggging. The 
default value is "1" (left mouse button), this attribute is customizable through
the "bind" method using the optional "data" argument.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.2, Released 2008-10-06

- Moved the drag init checks to avoid the switch statement when possible

- Made the drag.handler function private

- Renamed private data properties: dist2 -> distance, x -> pageX, y -> pageY
This will theoretically help reduce the gzipped file size.

- Moved distance squared calculation to the "setup" function from "mousdown"
because there is no reason to calculate this value more than once.

- fixed a bug where "event.dragProxy" was being set one "mousemove" event late

- added local variable refs for "$.event" and "$.event.special" to reduce file
size when minified/packed, and speed up execution.

- added private "squared" function to reduce file size/lines.

- added private "hijack" function to reduce file size/lines.

- change the drag method to trigger the "drag" handler instead of "mousedown"
which was an artifact from an earlier version of the code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.1, Released 2008-10-03

- Fixed a bug where the text-selection attributes that were disabled on 
"mousedown" were not being enabled on "mouseup" unless the element was dragged.

- Now restoring the event.target property that is captured on "mousedown" before 
handling "dragstart" events. This fixes buggy behavior involving "dragstart" 
and the "distance" setting, and attempting to capture "handle" elements.

- Modified the handler logic for the "dragstart" return value. The stack can 
now continue directly into the "drag" handler call from "dragstart" instead of 
waiting for the next "mousemove" event to fire. 

- Added a "not" property to the "jQuery.event.special.drag" object which allows 
the prevention of drag behavior for any event.target element that matches the 
property value (selector). The default value is ":input" and when jQuery 1.3 is 
released, this attribute will also be customizable through the "bind" method
using the optional "data" argument. Thanks to Elijah Insua for suggesting this
feature.

- Changed binding of "mousemove" and "mouseup" events from "document.body" to 
"document"... This fixes buggy behavior when the body element does not cover 
the entire window. Thanks to Jonah Fox (weepy) and Elijah Insua for pointing 
out this bug.
